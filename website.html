                This website! A simple collection of blog pages put together in HTML to be hosted using Github's pages feature. The site is made up of a main page featuring a brief introduction / profile about myself with each the projects I've worked on linked on this page. Each project links to a blog page (like this one) detailing the reasoning of how, why and what the project entails of (as well as some other details where needed). After working on a number of personal projects, I wanted a place to showcase some of the work I had completed and the skills I had gained. I felt that Github repo's werent the place to go into too much unneccesary detail, and had picked up some skills from other projects to make creating a simple website easy. With this, I felt that a personal website was a great place to do this.

            <h1 class="project-header">How does it work?</h1>
            <p class="project-text">
                Just simple HTML and CSS styling hosted using Github's pages system.  The main page uses a Javascript script to allow the user to filter projects by the skills available on the sidebar.
